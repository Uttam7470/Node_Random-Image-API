# Random Images API in Node.js

## Introduction

This project is a simple API that returns random images fetched from the Unsplash API. It is built using the Express.js framework, which is a minimalistic web application framework for Node.js. The project demonstrates basic backend development concepts, including setting up a server, defining routes, and handling HTTP requests and responses.

## Features

- **Express Framework**: The project uses the Express.js framework to simplify the creation of the web server and manage HTTP requests and responses.
- **API Endpoint**: A single API endpoint `/api/image/random` is defined to fetch a random image from Unsplash.
- **Fetching Data**: The `getRandomImage()` function is responsible for fetching a random image from the Unsplash API.
- **Server Configuration**: The server listens on port 1000 for incoming requests.

## How It Works

1. **API Endpoint**:  
   The `/api/image/random` endpoint is designed to handle GET requests. When a request is made to this endpoint, it fetches a random image URL from Unsplash and returns it in the response.

2. **Fetching Random Images**:  
   The `getRandomImage()` function makes an HTTP request to Unsplash's API endpoint to fetch a random image. The function returns the image URL, which is then sent to the client.

3. **Server Setup**:  
   The server is set up to listen on port 1000. When the server starts, it logs a message indicating that it’s running.
